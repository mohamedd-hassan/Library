\subsection{ftol2() in MSVC 2012}

Just found this in ftol2() standard C/C++ library function (float-to-long conversion routine) in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.

\lstinputlisting[style=customasmx86]{other/ftol2_EN.asm}

Note two identical \INS{FSTP}-s (\emph{float store with pop}) at the end. 
First I thought it was compiler anomaly (I'm collecting such cases just as someone do with butterflies),
but it seems, it's handwritten assembler piece, in msvcrt.lib there is an object file with this function in it,
and we can find this string in it:\\
\verb|f:\dd\vctools\crt_bld\SELF_X86\crt\prebuild\tran\i386\ftol2.asm| ---
that was probably a path to the file on developer's computer where msvcrt.lib was built.

So, bug, text editor-induced typo, or it was done by intent?
The code working correctly, anyway.
