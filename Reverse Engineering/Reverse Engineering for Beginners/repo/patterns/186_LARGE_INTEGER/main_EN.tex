\mysection{LARGE\_INTEGER structure case}
\label{LargeInteger}

\myindex{Microsoft}
\myindex{LARGE\_INTEGER}
Imagine this: late 1980s, you're Microsoft, and you're developing a new \emph{serious} \ac{OS} (Windows NT),
that will compete with Unices.
Target platforms has both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs.
\myindex{FILETIME}
And you need a 64-bit integer datatype for all sort of purposes, starting at
FILETIME\footnote{\url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime}} structure.

The problem: not all target C/C++ compilers support 64-bit integer yet (this is late 1980s).
Surely, this will be changed in (near) future, but not now.
What would you do?

While reading this, try to stop (and/or close this book) and think, how can you solve this problem.

\clearpage

This is what Microsoft did, something like this\footnote{Not a copypasted source code, I wrote this}:

\begin{lstlisting}
union ULARGE_INTEGER
{
    struct backward_compatibility
    {
        DWORD LowPart;
        DWORD HighPart;
    };
#ifdef NEW_FANCY_COMPILER_SUPPORTING_64_BIT
    ULONGLONG QuadPart;
#endif
};
\end{lstlisting}

This is a chunk of 8 bytes, which can be accessed via 64-bit integer QuadPart (if compiled using newer compiler),
or using two 32-bit integers (if compiled using old one).

QuadPart field is just absent here when compiled using old compiler.

Order is crucial: first field (LowPart) maps to lower 4 bytes of 64-bit value, second field (HighPart) maps to higher 4 bytes.

Microsoft also added utility functions for all the arithmetical operation, in a same manner as I already described:
\myref{sec:64bit_in_32_env}.

\myindex{Windows 2000}
And this is from the leaked Windows 2000 source code base:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customasmx86,caption=i386 arch]
;++
;
; LARGE\_INTEGER
; RtlLargeIntegerAdd (
;    IN LARGE\_INTEGER Addend1,
;    IN LARGE\_INTEGER Addend2
;    )
;
; Routine Description:
;
;    This function adds a signed large integer to a signed large integer and
;    returns the signed large integer result.
;
; Arguments:
;
;    (TOS+4) = Addend1 - first addend value
;    (TOS+12) = Addend2 - second addend value
;
; Return Value:
;
;    The large integer result is stored in (edx:eax)
;
;--

cPublicProc _RtlLargeIntegerAdd ,4
cPublicFpo 4,0

        mov     eax,[esp]+4             ; (eax)=add1.low
        add     eax,[esp]+12            ; (eax)=sum.low
        mov     edx,[esp]+8             ; (edx)=add1.hi
        adc     edx,[esp]+16            ; (edx)=sum.hi
        stdRET    _RtlLargeIntegerAdd

stdENDP _RtlLargeIntegerAdd
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=MIPS arch]
        LEAF_ENTRY(RtlLargeIntegerAdd)

        lw      t0,4 * 4(sp)            // get low part of addend2 value
        lw      t1,4 * 5(sp)            // get high part of addend2 value
        addu    t0,t0,a2                // add low parts of large integer
        addu    t1,t1,a3                // add high parts of large integer
        sltu    t2,t0,a2                // generate carry from low part
        addu    t1,t1,t2                // add carry to high part
        sw      t0,0(a0)                // store low part of result
        sw      t1,4(a0)                // store high part of result
        move    v0,a0                   // set function return register
        j       ra                      // return

        .end    RtlLargeIntegerAdd
\end{lstlisting}

Now two 64-bit architectures:

\myindex{Itanium}
\myindex{DEC Alpha}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Itanium arch]
        LEAF_ENTRY(RtlLargeIntegerAdd)

        add         v0 = a0, a1                 // add both quadword arguments
        LEAF_RETURN

        LEAF_EXIT(RtlLargeIntegerAdd)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=DEC Alpha arch]
        LEAF_ENTRY(RtlLargeIntegerAdd)

        addq    a0, a1, v0              // add both quadword arguments
        ret     zero, (ra)              // return

        .end    RtlLargeIntegerAdd
\end{lstlisting}

No need using 32-bit instructions on Itanium and DEC Alpha---64-bit ones are here already.

\myindex{Windows Research Kernel}
And this is what we can find in Windows Research Kernel:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
DECLSPEC_DEPRECATED_DDK         // Use native \_\_int64 math
__inline
LARGE_INTEGER
NTAPI
RtlLargeIntegerAdd (
    LARGE_INTEGER Addend1,
    LARGE_INTEGER Addend2
    )
{
    LARGE_INTEGER Sum;

    Sum.QuadPart = Addend1.QuadPart + Addend2.QuadPart;
    return Sum;
}
\end{lstlisting}

All these functions can be dropped (in future), but now they just operate on QuadPart field.
If this piece of code is to be compiled using a modern 32-bit compiler (that supports 64-bit integer),
it will generate two 32-bit additions under the hood.
From this moment, LowPart/HighPart fields can be dropped from the LARGE\_INTEGER union/structure.

Would you use such a technique today?
Probably not, but if someone would need 128-bit integer data type, you can implement it just like this.

Also, needless to say, this works thanks to \emph{little-endian} (\myref{sec:endianness})
(all architectures Windows NT was developed for are \emph{little-endian}).
This trick wouldn't be possible on a \emph{big-endian} architecture.
