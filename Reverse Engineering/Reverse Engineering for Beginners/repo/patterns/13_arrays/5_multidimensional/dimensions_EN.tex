\subsubsection{Getting dimensions of multidimensional array}
\myindex{Hex-Rays}

Any string processing function, if an array of characters passed to it, can't deduce a size of the input array.
Likewise, if a function processes 2D array, only one dimension can be deduced.

For example:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/13_arrays/5_multidimensional/dimensions2.c}

... if compiled (by any compiler) and then decompiled by Hex-Rays:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/13_arrays/5_multidimensional/dimensions2_hexrays.c}

There is no way to find a size of the first dimension.
If $x$ value passed is too big, buffer overflow would occur, an element from some random place of memory would be read.

And 3D array:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/13_arrays/5_multidimensional/dimensions3.c}

Hex-Rays:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{patterns/13_arrays/5_multidimensional/dimensions3_hexrays.c}

Again, sizes of only two of 3 dimensions can be deduced.
