In the pursuit of optimization, one instruction may be replaced by another, or even with a group of instructions.
For example, \ADD and \SUB can replace each other:
line 18 in \lstref{neg_array_c}.

For example, the \LEA instruction is often used for simple arithmetic calculations: \myref{sec:LEA}.
