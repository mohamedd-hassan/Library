\section{Zero register}

x86 architecture lacks zero register, unlike MIPS and ARM.
However, it's often a case, when a compiler assigns a zero to a register, that will hold it upon the function's exit.

This is a case of Mahjong game from Windows 7 x86.
Zeroed EBX (at 0x010281BF) is used to initialize local variables,
to pass zero argument into other functions and to compare values against it.

By the way, IDA can rename a register inside a function (press \verb|n|):
