\mysection{Homework: more about function pointers and unions}

This code was copypasted from \emph{dwm}\footnote{\url{https://dwm.suckless.org/}}, probably, the smallest ever Linux window manager.

The problem: keystrokes from user must be dispatched to various functions inside of \emph{dwm}.
This is usually solved using a big \emph{switch()}.

Usually, this is an important problem to be solved by a programmer of any videogame.

Supposedly, \emph{dwm}'s creators wanted to make the code neat and modifiable by users:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{\CURPATH/dwm.c}

For each keystroke (or shortcut) a function is defined.
Even more: a parameters (or arguments) to be passed to a function at each case.
But parameters can have various type.
So \emph{union} is used here.
A value of needed type is filled in the table.
Each function takes what it needs.

As a homework, try to write a code like that, or get into \emph{dwm}'s and see how \emph{union} is passed into functions and handled.
