\subsection{Pointer to a function: a common bug (or typo)}

A notorious bug/typo:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc]{advanced/450_more_ptrs/62.c}

Since the function's name alone is interpreted as a pointer to function, or its address,\\
the \verb|if(function_name)| statement is like \verb|if(true)|.

Unfortunately, a \CCpp compiler wouldn't issue a warning.
