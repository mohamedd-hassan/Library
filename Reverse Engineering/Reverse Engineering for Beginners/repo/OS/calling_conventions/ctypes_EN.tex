\subsection{Python ctypes problem (x86 assembly homework)}

\myindex{Python!ctypes}
A Python ctypes module can call external functions in DLLs, .so's, etc.
But calling convention (for 32-bit environment) must be specified explicitely:

\begin{lstlisting}
"ctypes" exports the *cdll*, and on Windows *windll* and *oledll*
objects, for loading dynamic link libraries.

You load libraries by accessing them as attributes of these objects.
*cdll* loads libraries which export functions using the standard
"cdecl" calling convention, while *windll* libraries call functions
using the "stdcall" calling convention.
\end{lstlisting}
( \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html} )

In fact, we can modify ctypes module (or any other caller code), so that it will successfully
call external cdecl or stdcall functions, without knowledge, which is where.
(Number of arguments, however, is to be specified).

This is possible to solve using maybe 5-10 x86 assembly instructions in caller.
Try to find out these.
