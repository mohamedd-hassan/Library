  \item[FUCOM] ST(i): compare ST(0) and ST(i)
  \item[FUCOM] compare ST(0) and ST(1)
  \item[FUCOMP] compare ST(0) and ST(1); pop one element from stack.
  \item[FUCOMPP] compare ST(0) and ST(1); pop two elements from stack.
 
The instructions perform just like FCOM, but an exception is raised only if one of the operands is SNaN,
  while QNaN numbers are processed smoothly.
