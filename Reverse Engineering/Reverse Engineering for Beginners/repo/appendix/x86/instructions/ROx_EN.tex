\item[ROL/ROR] (M) cyclic shift
  
ROL: rotate left:

ROR: rotate right:

\input{rotate_right}

Despite the 
fact that almost all \ac{CPU}s have these instructions, there are no corresponding
operations in \CCpp, so the compilers of these \ac{PL}s usually do not generate these 
instructions.

For the programmer's convenience, at least \ac{MSVC} has the pseudofunctions (compiler intrinsics)
\emph{\_rotl()} and \emph{\_rotr()}\FNMSDNROTxURL{},
which are translated by the compiler directly to these instructions.
