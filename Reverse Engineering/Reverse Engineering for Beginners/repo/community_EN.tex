\chapter{Communities}

There are two excellent \ac{RE}-related subreddits on reddit.com:\\
\href{http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/}{reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/} and
\href{http://www.reddit.com/r/remath}{reddit.com/r/remath}
(on the topics for the intersection of \ac{RE} and mathematics).

There is also a \ac{RE} part of the Stack Exchange website:\\
\href{http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/}{reverseengineering.stackexchange.com}.

On IRC there are \#\#re and \#\#asm channels on
FreeNode\footnote{\href{https://freenode.net/}{freenode.net}}.
