<h3>Download the 'Reverse Engineering for Beginners' book</h3>

<p>To access it, you need to get a user/password <a href="http://link.yurichev.com/47000">by becoming my patron at patreon.com</a>.</p>

<p>1 (one) USD or the equivalent would be fine.</p>

<p>Sorry, there are no other payment methods. No PayPal, cryptocurrencies, etc...</p>

<p><b>In other words, I am selling the RE4B book for donations on patreon.com. Yes, this is a paywall</b></p>

<p>
And thank you all for your support.
They say, even a smallest donation helps.
This is true.
You all help me a great deal!

N.B.: 'user001' and 'user002' accounts are expired.
Current club members/donors/patrons can ask me for an updated login/password.
Or copy&paste the new login/password from my patreon page.
